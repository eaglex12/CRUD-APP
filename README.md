# CRUD-APP-REACT-JS
 A CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) app is an application that allows users to perform basic database operations on data stored on a server. When building a CRUD app in React JS and Axios API, the following components and features are typically needed:

React Components: React components are the building blocks of any React app. In a CRUD app, components such as forms, tables, and modals are needed to create, read, update, and delete data.

Axios: Axios is a popular JavaScript library used for making HTTP requests. In a CRUD app, Axios is used to send requests to the server and retrieve data.

Server-side API: A server-side API (Application Programming Interface) is required to handle HTTP requests and perform CRUD operations on a database.

Routing: React Router is used to handle routing in a React app. In a CRUD app, routing is used to navigate between pages and components.

State Management: In React, state management is essential for handling the dynamic data and interactions of the app. Redux, MobX, or React's built-in state management system can be used to manage the state of a CRUD app.

Validation: Form validation is an essential aspect of any CRUD app. React provides built-in form validation, but third-party libraries such as Formik and Yup can also be used.

Security: Security is a crucial aspect of any web app. In a CRUD app, measures such as authentication and authorization are needed to ensure data security.

Overall, a CRUD app in React JS and Axios API provides a user-friendly interface for creating, reading, updating, and deleting data from a server-side database. With its flexible and scalable components, a CRUD app can be customized to meet specific business needs.
